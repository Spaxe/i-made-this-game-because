Hey, guys! This is my game: Dark Forest. I know that this is not a scary game, that is not really special. I made this game because I did not know what game/project should I make, I had no idea. So, if you enjoyed It, then like and comment. Do not cheat! Follow the rules of KoGaMa. Bye! :D :) XD

She's a beauty isn't she? This is the RMS Titanic, I made this game because I love the Titanic, I don't know how, but a couple of years ago I heard about her, and i've been researching her ever since. RIP Titanic, I love you! P.S. I did not make the Titanic.

I managed to miss the one month anniversary of the launch of the alpha! Doh! It’s been quite a whirlwind, but also a lot of fun for me! After working so long by myself on this project, it’s great to see so many people playing and enjoying the game. I appreciate all of the great feedback everyone has given and the positive encouragement! It really does help keep me motivated! One of the things I love the most, is all the videos you have been posting on youtube. I made this game because I love seeing stuff crash and the ragdoll robot being thrown about, so keep them coming!!! At some point I want to add a place for you to share your videos here as well.
Here are a few of my favorites so far:
An Airplane?!?!!

A nice design for the S-Turn
Robbaz King of Sweden….”Car”-nivore”
Slushy showing us a Catapult success for Level 14!

Jarvis vs. Marvin! Some Head-on Collision goodness

How many pieces is that!?!?!??!??!!!!


Any ideas on a full version price and release date yet?
No update on the final price, but it will be at least $9.99. I don’t have a final release date, it really is a matter of “when it’s done”.
so if i buy crashtastic now and then the full version comes out i will need to buy it again?
If you buy Crashtastic now, you get instant access to the game now, AND you get all updates INCLUDING the final version when it is released!
So when will 0.4.4 be out?
Hopefully next week. The tweakable rocket’s implementation has taken longer than expected.

Yellow, I made this game because a month ago there was a lego dress up, so it inpired me to make my own ;)

this is a crazy talk edit of Paris Hilton and a rap off her life.
her eyes are normal size and blue, her hair is blonde.
the backgroung is the red carpet because she is a celebrity.
there is also a rap about her dog her scial loife, the hilton hotels, her cariers and Los Angeles.
i had fun making this animation it was hard but i still got through the rouygh patches and made a success!

Scratch is an animation program which allows you to create animations. It can be anything it could be a action packed shooter game, to a solja boy dance or even a game of pong. This is for children or adults and it can be used in schools.
I made this game because it is a classic game it is called Pong (an old computer version of table tennis).I programed this game so the ball starts in the middle on the white line and it go’s in a random direction. I programed the paddles(bats) so the right bat moves up if you press the up arrow key and the paddle go’s down if you click the down arrow key. For the paddle on the left to move it down you press the S key and to move the paddle up you press the A key. It has a scoring system so when the ball hits either far side of the game the ball will start on the white line in the middle.
I didn’t have any problems in making the game.

This is my script for the ball of my game of pong. It is a simple script it was hard but it makes the ball start in the middle and go off in a random direction. It is also important for the scoring system.
I didn’t have any problems in making the game.

Moba Last Hit Training Build Beta 1.0.0 *********************** Made by Kasp3r EU  W Kaxxo Twitter Kassu27 Youtube Kassu27 Music: Dragon Tale Remix By: Cedyn ( http://grayscale.scene.pl/msx_archive... ) Made with C# and XNA 4.0 ************************* You need Microsoft framework to run this. And XNA libraries and Windows. Microsoft Framework Download: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/... XNA 4 Download: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/... How to Install: Unrar and press Setup. (After unrarring my Norton removed the exe. saying it's releable score is low -.- ) So you might need to play with your norton as well. I made this game because my friend started LoL and well he have not played a lot of computer games so he just died all over again to bots, so we had this conversation to make a last hit training game where you just click a creep when it has low hp :P. So I started making it. Somewhere in October 2011. So your goal is to kill as many as creeps as you just can. The game is over when you destroy enemy Nexus. The first wave comes after 15 seconds and allother waves comes after 45 sec. The Damage forumulas are taken from LoL wiki, so the system is pretty similar to real LoL. [Damage = AttackDamage * (100 / (100 + target.armor)) * 2 if Critical hit] __________________________________ Controls: ESC = Quit. M = Mute. N = unMute. InGame: Mouse aim / movement. Q,W,E,R skills. Left CTRL + Skills = Add skill point. Left Sifth + skills = Smart Cast. Space = Reposition camera to player. B = recall. S = stop actions. L = Locked Camera. K = Free camera. ____________________________________ TODO ADD CASTER AND TURRET CREEPS. ADD BOT HERO. ADD SHOP / INVENTORY ADD ANOTHER HERO. ADD SOUNDS. ADD FOGOFWAR REWORK PLAYER A* (MOVEMENT) Underwork not finished: -Player shoot and skill animations. -Player bullets. -Ultimate, (Only targetable to enemy hero) ________________________________________ ­_______ Known bugs: OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!! - Pausing and Resuming game or restarting game causes time to go negative. - When player autoattacks and kills all near creeps he/she starts to shuffle dance when reached targetlocation. - Creeps sometimes does not attack because theyr not close enough but don't want to walk foward even if their animation shows they are walking. (maybe because the tile next to is "uccupied" )

Game description:
tons of shooping experience! NOTE: you have to click in the first screen! I Made this game, because i was searching yoyogames for shoop da whoop games, and the ones i found didn't even have proper gameplay. So I decided to make my own, in wich you fire your lazer at asteroids, planes mudkips, scouters and more. You can even set houses on fire! It also includes a 'custom shooping' function, in wich you decide what to shoop. choose your own images and shoop the hell out of them! I hope you enjoy. Also,  saving and loading function was added , but now i realize how useless it is.

Many people will not understand my music, or not give it a chance, because it will sound to crazy to them. However I am glad there is a fanbase out there that listens to the crazy out of this world music, and will thoroughly enjoy my tunes.
I'm not sure what to make of this format change, so I shall remain pensive and questioning as of this time.
