(After unrarring my Norton removed the exe. saying it's releable score is low -.- ) So you might need to play with your norton as well. I made this game because my friend started LoL and well he have not played a lot of computer games so he just died all over again to bots, so we had this conversation to make a last hit training game where you just click a creep when it has low hp :P. So I started making it. Somewhere in October 2011. So your goal is to kill as many as creeps as you just can. The game is over when you destroy enemy Nexus. The first wave comes after 15 seconds and allother waves comes after 45 sec. The Damage forumulas are taken from LoL wiki, so the system is pretty similar to real LoL. [Damage = AttackDamage * (100 / (100 + target.armor)) * 2 if Critical hit] __________________________________ Controls: ESC = Quit. M = Mute. N = unMute. InGame: Mouse aim / movement. Q,W,E,R skills. Left CTRL + Skills = Add skill point. Left Sifth + skills = Smart Cast. Space = Reposition camera to player. B = recall. S = stop actions. L = Locked Camera. K = Free camera. ____________________________________ TODO ADD CASTER AND TURRET CREEPS. ADD BOT HERO. ADD SHOP / INVENTORY ADD ANOTHER HERO. ADD SOUNDS.
